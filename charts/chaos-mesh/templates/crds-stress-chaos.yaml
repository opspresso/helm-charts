                dialect, however not all of the supported stressors are well tested.
                It maybe retired in later releases. You should always use `Stressors`
                to define the stressors and use this only when you want more stressors
                unsupported by `Stressors`. When both `StressngStressors` and `Stressors`
                are defined, `StressngStressors` wins.
